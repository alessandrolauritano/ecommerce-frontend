# React w/ Typescript frontend for an e-commerce Cart

This project shows an e-commerce with few products. The user has the possibility to navigate through three sections - thanks to React Router - "Home", "About" and "Store", which is the core of this webapp.
In this section (Store), the user has the possibility to add some products with quantities to the cart, which shoes the grand total.

## Installation

```bash
$ vite
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Things that can be improved in the future

- [x] Implementing the logic for the single product buttons ("+" and "-")
- [x] Implement the total quantity for the cart
- [x] Create a dedicated section for the cart (Sidebar)
- [ ] Create a dedicated "Checkout" section
